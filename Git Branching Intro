================================= GIT BRANCHING

Like controlling alternate universes

Important commands...
  git checkout BRANCH_NAME_HERE ---- used to move from one branch to another
  git branch BRANCH_NAME_HERE ------ used to create a branch
  git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME_HERE - used to create a new branch and checkout to it
  git branch ----------------------- used to see what branch you are on
  git branch -D BRANCH_NAME_HERE --- used to delete a branch
  git merge BRANCH_NAME_HERE ------- used to take work from one branch and copy it over to another

Real world application: various team members or teams work on different branches

A new branch can be created for each team member or feature

Commits almost never happen on the master branch



================================= GIT BRANCHING FOLLOW ALONG EXERCISE

(open terminal and run the following commands)

(move to desktop)
cd ~/desktop

(create a new directory)
mkdir branch-test

(move into the directory)
cd branch-test

(make it a Git repo)
git init

(create a file)
touch master.txt

(add file to staging area)
git add .

(commit the file)
git commit -m 'add file in master branch'

(view branches; only master should be seen)
git branch

(create a new branch)
git branch another-branch

(view branches again; notice that two branchs now exist)
git branch

(move to another-branch from master)
git checkout another-branch

(view branches and verify no longer in master branch)
git branch

(create a new file)
touch another.txt

(check the status)
git status

(add to staging)
git add .

(commit in another-branch)
git commit -m 'add file in another-branch'

(view current file)
ls

(move back to master branch)
git checkout master

(view files; notice another.txt is no longer here)
ls

(look at commit history accross the two branches)
git log

(move work from another-branch to the master branch)
git merge another-branch

(view files; another.txt should now be here)
ls

(create a third branch; notice it is a copy of the current master branch)
git checkout -b yet-another-branch

(view files)
ls
